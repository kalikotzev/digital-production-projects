                    <p>Kalina is from the town of Marblehead, Massachusetts and is in her 
                        second year at Fordham University. Her connection with the arts began at 
                        a young age as she played the piano and learned music theory starting in late elementary school. In high school 
                        she began painting at a local art studio and fell in love with it. This led her to develop a deeper involvement 
                        in the arts as a whole. She developed further interests in film, photography, and fashion history and theory which 
                        she hope to integrate in future work.  </p>

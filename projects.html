Some members of the team at the Jazz Foundation tell us about the care provided by this organization that consists of largely mutual aid to jazz, blues, and roots musicians in need of assistance, many of those as a result of various crises or catastrophic events. This non-profit organization provide much-needed care to life-long jazz musicians so they may continue their crafts and live comfortables lives--a small return for the enormous gift these musicians give to the world through their talents and brings joy to musicians and audiences alike through the performances they produce. </figcaption>
